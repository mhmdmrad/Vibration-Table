# Small Vibration Table Project

This project is a **small vibration table** designed to remove trapped air bubbles in resins, concrete, or plaster.  
It ensures smooth, uniform surfaces and stronger casts by vibrating the material before it hardens.

## Features
- Compact design with **four springs** and a **9V DC motor**.  
- **Offset weight** on the motor shaft creates vibrations.  
- Designed and modeled in **SolidWorks**.  
- Motor speed controlled by **Arduino Nano** + **potentiometer** via L298N driver.


## Applications
- Resin casting  
- Concrete samples  
- Plaster molds  


## Future Improvements
- Optimize spring stiffness to match resonance with motor frequency  
- Add damping pads to reduce noise  
- Implement feedback sensor (accelerometer) to measure vibration amplitude
